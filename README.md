# 🎓 Grade Calculator Program – C Language Project

## 📌 Description
This project is a console-based program in C that calculates and displays a student’s grade based on their score (out of 100). The program progresses in three steps:

- **Step 1:** Uses a ternary operator to assign a grade (A, B, C, D, F)
- **Step 2:** Adds performance feedback using a switch-case statement
- **Step 3:** Checks eligibility for the next level using if-else statements
